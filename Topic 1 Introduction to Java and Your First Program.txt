Welcome to Core Java for Automation Testing! 🎉

I'm excited to teach you Java step by step. Let's begin with the very first topic.

📘 Topic 1: Introduction to Java & Your First Program

What is Java?

Java is a programming language that is:

    Platform Independent - Write once, run anywhere
    Object-Oriented - Everything revolves around "objects"
    Most widely used in automation testing (Selenium, Rest Assured, Appium)

Understanding JDK, JRE, JVM

Simple Explanation:

Component
	

Purpose

JDK
	

For developers - includes compiler + JRE

JRE
	

For running Java programs

JVM
	

Actually executes your code

Your First Java Program

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, I am learning Java for Automation!");
    }
}

Output:

Hello, I am learning Java for Automation!

Let's Break Down Each Part

public class HelloWorld {

Keyword
	

Meaning

public
	

Accessible from anywhere

class
	

Blueprint/template (everything in Java is inside a class)

HelloWorld
	

Name of the class (must match filename: HelloWorld.java)

public static void main(String[] args) {

This is the main method - the entry point of your program.

Keyword
	

Meaning

public
	

Accessible from anywhere

static
	

Can run without creating an object

void
	

Returns nothing

main
	

Method name (JVM looks for this)

String[] args
	

Command line arguments

System.out.println("Hello, I am learning Java for Automation!");

Part
	

Meaning

System
	

A built-in class

out
	

Output stream

println
	

Print and go to new line

"text"
	

String (text) to print

Print Statements

public class PrintDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // println - prints and moves to next line
        System.out.println("Line 1");
        System.out.println("Line 2");
        
        // print - prints and stays on same line
        System.out.print("Hello ");
        System.out.print("World");
        
    }
}

Output:

Line 1
Line 2
Hello World

📝 Quick Practice Exercise

Try to understand this code:

public class MyFirstTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Starting Automation Test");
        System.out.println("Opening Browser...");
        System.out.println("Test Completed!");
    }
}

Questions for you:

    What is the class name?
    How many print statements are there?
    What will be the output?
